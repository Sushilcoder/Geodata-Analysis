# Land Cover Classification using Random Forest

Machine Learning using Google Earth Engine is a powerful approach for analyzing and interpreting large-scale geospatial data.GEE is a cloud-based platform that provides access to a vast
archive of satellite imagery and geospatial datasets, enabling users to perform planetary-scale analysis

# Steps
• Load and Preprocess Data: Sentinel-2 imagery is loaded, filtered,
and preprocessed.

• Training Data: Training data is collected, typically using polygons
labeled with the correct land cover class

• Model Training: A Random Forest classifier is trained using the
training data

• Classification: The trained model is applied to classify the entire
region

• Visualization: The classified map is displayed with different colors
representing different land cover classes
